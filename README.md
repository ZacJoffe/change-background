A simple bash script to change the background and set [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) color profiles accordingly.

By default it selects a random wallpaper from the `~/Wallpapers/Landscapes/` directory, but also accepts a file or directory. It will randomly select a file from the directory.

## Dependencies

This script requires bash, pywal, and feh.

## Usage

Simply call the script optionally with a file/directory as an argument.

```
./change ~/Wallpapers/
```
